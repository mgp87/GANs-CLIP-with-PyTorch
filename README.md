## Generative AI for image generation: GANs & CLIP with PyTorch

This repo contains code from a course on Generative AI talking about GANs, CLIP with PyTorch. The course is available on Udemy by Javier Ideami.

### 1. Reinforcement Learning
- RL: Agents that learn to optimize target finding through trial and error by chasing rewards.
- In GenAI, the agent hallucinates scenarios where it tests different strategies to find the best one.

### 2. GAN Training
